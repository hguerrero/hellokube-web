## Hey there! 👋

I'm **Hugo Guerrero**, a developer turned *dust fairy* ✨ who sprinkles joy over developers struggling with **APIs**, **messaging**, and **Kubernetes**.

## My Journey 🚀

My tech journey has been quite the adventure:

- **Early Days**: Started as a Windows developer in the 2000s, building .NET applications and Java clients
- **The Linux Leap**: Joined the world's biggest Linux company (Red Hat), where I had to rapidly level up my Linux skills
- **Cloud Native Advocate**: Now I focus on helping developers navigate the complex world of Kubernetes, containers, and cloud-native technologies

I've worn many hats—from developer to middleware specialist to developer advocate—and each role taught me something valuable about making technology more accessible.

## What I Do 💼

I help developers succeed with:

- **🚢 Kubernetes** - Making container orchestration less intimidating
- **📦 Containers** - Docker, Podman, and everything in between
- **⚡ Event Streaming** - Apache Kafka and messaging architectures
- **🛠️ Developer Experience** - Tools and workflows that actually work
- **☁️ Cloud Native** - Practical patterns for real-world applications

## Why This Blog? 📝

I created **Hello Kube** because I believe that:

1. **Learning should be practical** - Every tutorial here is hands-on and tested
2. **Complexity can be simplified** - Cloud-native doesn't have to be overwhelming
3. **Community matters** - Sharing knowledge makes us all better developers

Whether you're just starting with Kubernetes or looking to level up your cloud-native skills, I hope you'll find something useful here.
